				<h1><strong>Communication Barriers in Dental Care</strong></h1>
			</header>
			<p>In the globalization of the world, more and more non-native English speakers are coming to the UK and
				many of these
				patients face communication challenges in accessing healthcare.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project aims to improve the dental experience for non-native English-speaking patients by providing
				functions such as disease self-examination and oral modelling in the app to enhance patients' confidence
				in the process.</p>

				<p>Based on the improved IA to design Lo-Fi, to further test the improved IA as well as to validate
					whether the patient's illness can be effectively expressed through this app and allow the
					patient to be more confident
					in their medical treatment, a task-based user testing approach was used to test the
					effectiveness of the Lo-Fi
					test. The following picture shows the improved Lo-Fi.

			<div>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>• The current app can help patients to a certain extent by increasing their confidence in helping
					them express their
					need for access to healthcare.<br>
					• However, the app still remains insufficient during actual clinical encounters. For first-time
					patients, tangible
					diagnostic procedures such as X-rays remain essential, and the disease self-examination system can
					only be used as an
					assist.<br>
					• In addition, the interface will be refined as the research progresses and efforts will be made to
					conduct rigorous
					validity evaluations, such as clinical impact assessments, to determine its clinical applicability.
