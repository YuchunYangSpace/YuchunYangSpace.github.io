							Because the symptoms are unobvious or relatively slight, coronary heart disease is easily
							overlooked in the early stage.
							For elderly people with this disease, delayed treatment may lead to further deterioration of
							the
							condition. With daily
							activities as the starting point, the elderly are tested for coronary heart disease in the
							process of doing grocery
							shopping. According to the test results, the elderly and their children are reminded to go
							to
							the hospital for
							examination.

						<h3>• Prevalence of cardiovascular disease</h3>
						<p>
							According to China Cardiovascular Health and Disease Report 2020, it can be estimated that
							the number of people
							suffering from cardiovascular disease is as high as <u>330 millions</u>, of which
							<u>11.39millions</u>patients suffer from coronary disease.
						</p>
						<h3>• Mortality rate of cardiovascular disease</h3>

							</div>
						</div>
						<div style="display: inline-block;width: 48%;">
							<p>In 2018, the mortality rate of Chinese patients with cardiovascular disease was
								<u>298.77/100,000 (0.29877%)</u>, of which the
								mortality rate of heart disease was <u>154.23/100,000 (0.15423%)</u>.
							</p>
							<P>
								Among the major causes of death among Chinese residents in 2018, cardiovascular
								disease
								accounted for <u>45.24%</u>. (Coronary
								disease is a type of heart disease.)

						<h3>• How to diagnose coronary disease</h3>
						<p>The early symptoms of coronary disease are not obvious, making it difficult for patients to
							find it.</p>
						<p>The electrocardiogram can reflect the electrical activity of the heart, which has high
							sensitivity and important
							diagnostic significance for the clinical data (including lesion location, range and depth)
							of arrhythmia, myocardial
							ischemia, myocardial infarction and other symptoms in coronary disease.</p>
						<h3>• Age of illness</h3>
						<p>According to the 2015 statistics released by the National Health and Family Planning
							Commission, the prevalence of
							coronary disease among people under 40 is very low. The prevalence begins to increase after
							the age of 40 and doubles
							every 10 years.</p>

						<h3>• Elderly population data</h3>
						<p>According to the data of the seventh national census in 2020, the population over 65 in China
							currently accounts for
							approximately 13.5% of the total population.</p>

						<h3>• Summary:</h3>
						<p>
							According to the interview survey, the five elderly interviewed all have the habit of doing
							grocery shopping, with 1-1.5
							hours of time spent as well as the main travel mode of walking or taking the bus. Three of
							the five have heart disease
							and are equipped with sphygmomanometer.
						</p>
						<p>According to in-depth interview, they do grocery shopping in supermarkets and markets around
							their homes. Some elderly
							people carry shopping carts, cloth bags, hooks, ropes and other items during grocery
							shopping.
						</p>
						<p>Most of their children often contact them and understand their living habits and life
							trajectories.
						</p>
					</div>
					<!-- 4 Observation -->
					<div>
						<h2>4 Observation</h2>
						<p>
							The observation results show that most users use one hand when using household shopping
							cart,
							supermarket hand-pulling
							basket and supermarket shopping basket. The use of supermarket trolley can be divided into
							three
							types, namely one hand,
							both hands, and no armrest. Among them, most users hold the armrest with one hand when
							viewing
							the goods on the shelf.
						</p>
						<p>
							A test can be completed by continuously contacting the sensor with the limbs on both sides
							of
							the heart for 30 seconds.
						</p>
						<p>
							Keep body still during the test.
						</p>
						<p>
							When using the supermarket trolley, the user can just touch the armrest with two hands or
							two
							arms, which meets the
							basic conditions for testing electrocardiogram. At the same time, users have the possibility
							of
							continuous contact for
							30 seconds during the process of pushing trolley, so this design will be applied to
							supermarket
							trolley.

						<h2>5 Technical research</h2>
						<p>
							Electrocardiogram is a technology that uses an electrocardiogram machine to record the
							pattern
							of changes in electrical
							activity produced by each cardiac cycle. The electrocardiogram can be used to determine
							whether
							the subject is likely to
							suffer from coronary disease.

						<h3>• Alivecor Kardia Mobile</h3>
						<p>There are two textured sensors in Kardia.
						</p>
						<p>Connect Kardia and iPhone.
						</p>
						<p>Place finger on the sensor for 30 seconds to obtain the electrocardiogram.</p>
						<img src="./picture/5.png" class="image fit">
						<h3>• Apple watch</h3>
						<p>The wrist of one hand fits the apple watch, and the other hand is on the crown.</p>
						<p>The test takes 30 seconds.</p>
						<p>Record test results via mobile app.</p>
						<p>Keep body as still as possible.</p>
