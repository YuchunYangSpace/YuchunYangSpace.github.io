					<h2>1 Abstract</h2>
					<p>
						Food waste and hunger have become serious problems in the world. One of the solutions is to
						donate leftover food to hungry people through food donations. However, due to the lack of
						convenient donation platforms and food supervision,this problem is still serious. Therefore,
						design a donation platform that is more convenient for young families and monitor food safety
						through charities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interviews with 371 low-income Toronto families revealed that 75 percent had experienced some
						food insecurity,
						but only
						23 percent had used a food bank; for most food bank users, food insecurity was a severe and
						chronic problem
						(Loopstra
						and Tarasuk, 2012).

					<h2>3 Analyse the problem</h2>
					<p>
						There are many ways to reduce food waste and feed the hungry, one of which is food donation.
					</p>
					<h3>• User flow:</h3>
					<img src="./picture/2.png" alt="User Flow" title="User Flow" class="image fit">
					<h3>• Household / Donor:</h3>
					<p>
						Reusing leftovers is considered one of the most effective strategies to combat food waste at
						the
						household
						level(Schanes, Dobernig and Gözet, 2018); the youths waste more than elderly people, above
						all
						compared with
						people aged
						65 or over who were found to waste significantly less food than the rest of the population;
						the
						process of
						donation is
						very complex(De Boeck et al., 2017); food safety, do not know food waste diversion avenues,
						lack
						of time and
						space(Goodman-Smith, Mirosa and Skeaff, 2020)
					</p>
					<h3>• Charity:</h3>
					<p>
						Food banks have also their own problems: Poor distribution strategies, informality in
						handling
						and delivering
						food, lack
						of infrastructure, the mismatch between the supply and nutrition needs, among others (Mejia
						et
						al., 2015);
					</p>
					<h3>• Low-income families:</h3>
					<p>
						Interviews with 371 low-income Toronto families revealed that 75 percent had experienced
						some
						food insecurity,
						but only
						23 percent had used a food bank; for most food bank users, food insecurity was a severe and
						chronic problem
						(Loopstra
						and Tarasuk, 2012).
					</p>
					<h2>4 Existing the Solutions</h2>
					<h3>• Olio</h3>

					<p>
						This app could help UK residents or businesses share unwanted food to avoid waste. Users can
						upload food photos
						and
						related information.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, due to the lack of supervision, this software may have food safety problems, and
						users
						will worry about
						it and
						reduce its use.
					</p>
					<h3>• To good to go</h3>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<img src="./picture/5.PNG" class="image fit">
								</td>
								<td>
									<img src="./picture/6.PNG" class="image fit">

					</table>
					<p>
						This software can provide restaurants with a platform to reduce food waste and mainly
						address
						leftover or
						unsellable
						food in restaurants. It allows restaurants to upload photos and related information, and
						allows
						consumers to buy
						at low
						prices.
					</p>
					<p>
						But it is also burdensome for some low-income users to buy at low prices. At the same time,
						it
						cannot provide a channel for sharing food leftovers in the family.
					</p>
					<h3>• Flashfood</h3>
					<p>
						The software reduces waste by reselling food at a lower price, as well as “not good enough”
						food. Like the TO
						GOOD TO
						GO, Flashfood also faces certain problems, and low-income groups will be discouraged by the
						price.
					</p>
					<h3>• Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						Since young people’s families waste relatively more, the users are defined as young family
						groups. At the same
						time,
						because food safety needs to be considered, charities are included in the design system to
						control food safety.
						According to the above problems, design a food donation platform that can provide young
						people
						with more
						convenience,
						and provide charities with a clear delivery platform for food delivery.
					</p>
					<h2>5 Technical support</h2>
					<p>
						Since mobile phones are the most widely used technology by human beings in today’s world, at
						the
						same time, the
						target
						audience is young people, to carry out the most basic tasks, we choose the technology to be
						a
						mobile
						application. Based
						on the technology in mobile phones, it is possible to create more technological applications
						for
						mobile phone
						software,
						such as internet access, global positioning systems (GPS), access to data, microphones and
						cameras, and “… not
						only to
						take high-resolution photographs, but also to read QR/barcodes (Teacher et al., 2013).
					</p>
					<h3>• Login System</h3>
					<p>
						A login system will be required to identify users and distinguish between donors and charity
						organisations. As
						part of
						the technology that is commonly used in software, the login system is always linked to a
						Google
						account, a
						Facebook
						account or an Apple account, or users can register a username and password in the app to
						access
						the service. By
						creating
						user accounts, the software can store users’ addresses and information and protect the
						user’s
						privacy
						(shirali-shahreza
						and Shirali-Shahreza, 2007).
					</p>
					<h3>• Location Access</h3>
					<p>
						To enable location access, show nearby charities, and navigate to an address, GPS and
						location
						services will be
						required. As indicated by (von Watzdorf and Michahelles, 2010), mobile phone GPS technology
						allows users to know
						each
						other’s locations more accurately (von Watzdorf and Michahelles, 2010). For this, Google
						Maps
						will be integrated
						with
						the app.
					</p>
					<h3>• Camera</h3>
					<p>
						The third technology needed is the camera. The phone always comes with a camera lens, but
						the
						software requires
						the user
						to authorise the camera to capture images, as in the case of the photo uploading application
						ZoneTag, reviewed
						by (Ames
						et al., 2010), which can even add comments and tags to the uploaded photos.
					</p>
					<h3>• Central Database</h3>
					<p>
						A central database will be required to store all the important information and records, such
						as
						the details of
						the
						donors and charity organisations, the messages in chats, pictures uploaded, and a lot more.
						For
						this purpose, we
						will
						use Firebase as the database. As described by Khawas and Shah, Firebase “is a paid service
						which
						is a
						cross-platform
						solution for messages and notifications”, that “enables the application developer to
						understand
						how users are
						using the
						application” and also “supports social login provider like Facebook, Google (Khawas & Shah,
						2018). Hence using
						Firebase,
						login, messaging/chat and notifications features will be supported.
					</p>
					<h3>• Confirmation Code and Authenticator</h3>
					<p>
						The fifth technology we intend to use is a confirmation code generator and authenticator, as
						in
						the Deliveroo
						app. This
						code will verify and match if the organisation is collecting from the respective/correct
						donor
						who chose to hand
						over
						their meal to them. Similarly, this technology is used for food deliveries to prevent food
						loss.
						As shown in
						Figure 1,
						in Deliveroo, when a delivery exceeds twenty pounds, riders must enter a two-digit
						electronic
						code provided by
						the
						customer to confirm their delivery (“Deliveroo | Introducing customer confirmation codes,”
						n.d.).
					</p>
					<h2>6 User Journey</h2>
					<img src="./picture/user journey.jpg" class="image fit">
					<h3>• For donors</h3>
					<p>
						After logging in to the software, the user uploads the information of the food that needs to
						be
						donated, and
						then
						donates according to the type of food that different charities need, and then selects the
						delivery method to
						complete
						the food donation.
					</p>
					<h3>• For riders</h3>
					<p>
						Riders receive order information Accept food and deliver to the charity.
					</p>
					<h3>• For charities</h3>
					<p>
						The charity publishes the food demand, receives and checks the food donation information
						from
						the donor, and the
						rider
						or donor starts to deliver the food after approval.

					<h4>User stories:</h4>
					<p>
						User story 1: As someone who ends up buying extra groceries, way more than the required
						quantity, I
						want to donate
						six boxes
						of grapes, four bags of lettuce, five packets of corn, two boxes of chicken legs, and 3
						loaves
						of bread, so that
						I do
						not have to throw them in the garbage as they are about to expire.
					</p>
					<p>
						User story 2：I have placed a donation order and chosen the pickup service by the charity
						organisation. The
						representative
						will arrive in 20 minutes. I exited the app and started watching YouTube on my phone. Later
						when
						the
						representative
						arrives, I need to quickly access the confirmation code for the donation order.
					</p>
					<p>
						User story 3: I am at the checkout counter at Waitrose and need to quickly access the
						discount
						voucher I earned as a
						reward
						in exchange for a donation, so that I can scan the QR code and utilise my discount.

					<h4>User story:</h4>
					<p>
						Story 1: As a representative of a charity organisation, I want to reject a donation request

						the
						picture and description added by the donor were unclear and not satisfactory.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story 2: As a representative of a charity organisation who is responsible for the execution
						of a
						donation, I
						want to
						upload a picture showing the donation is complete so that the donor can confirm the
						successful
						completion of the
						donation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story 3: As a representative of a charity organisation, I am travelling to the donor’s given
						address to collect
						their
						donation, but I can’t seem to find their exact location, so I need to call them to help me
						reach
						them.

					</p>
					<h4>Users problem & Changing:</h4>
					<p>
						Users’ problem & Changing 1: They wanted to directly edit the image to point out the
						food-related problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Users’ problem & Changing 2: They could not find the place to upload process to donors.
					</p>
					<p>
